# Eyes Exercise

<img src="Eyes.png" width='300px'/>

This excercise uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic page where the eyes rendered will respond via the mouseover function, resulting in eye movement that follows the user's mouse.  

How To Use

Load the HTML file into the browser and scroll over the screen to see the eyes track the movement of the mouse.

Roadmap To Future Improvement

This program can be manipulated to change the eye or background color, or even the number of eyes and their relative placement on the screen.
